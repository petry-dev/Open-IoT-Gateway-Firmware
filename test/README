# Open IoT Gateway 📡

Industrial firmware developed for ESP32, acting as a universal factory floor gateway. The project implements a robust Wi-Fi provisioning system (Captive Portal), sensor reading, and telemetry transmission for Industry 4.0 applications.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Web Provisioning:** Embedded interface (stored in LittleFS) for Wi-Fi and MQTT configuration without recompiling code.
* **Responsive Interface:** Modern, responsive, and *offline-first* configuration dashboard, using Emojis for lightweight compatibility.
* **Visual Feedback:** Connection validation system with real-time feedback and automatic reboot.
* **Protocols:**
    * **MQTT:** Optimized JSON transmission (`IO Check`, `Sensors`, `RSSI`).
    * **Modbus/MTConnect:** Architecture ready for industrial protocol expansion.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** C++ (PlatformIO / Arduino Framework)
* **Hardware:** ESP32 (Compatible with ESP8266/PIC with adaptations)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (CSS Variables), Vanilla JS (Fetch API)
* **Storage:** LittleFS (Optimized SPIFFS File System)
